# nginx-proxy-pwa

nginx-proxy-pwa adds some common rules to nginx-proxy:alpine support PWAs with http/2 push manifest.
An example issue this image attempts to alleviate is the instance of the error `upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream` during reverse proxy of http/2 requests.

This image extends (jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine)[https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy], and users should refer that repository's documentation for additional info regarding nginx-proxy.

## Usage

The following example assumes an http server (i.e. nodeJS-express) open to port 3001, with SSL at the proxy.

Generating certs (required for http/2 and service-worker):
`mkdir certs`
`cd certs`
`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./localhost.key -out ./localhost.crt`
